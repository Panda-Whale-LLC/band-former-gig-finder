# band-former-gig-finder

## About Our App

A music matchmaking app with basic CRUD-functionality. Built using React Router and Redux Toolkit utilizing MongoDb for storage.

### Problem:

Local musicians can find it difficult to form bands and get gigs, especially in a new area. People searching for either bands to hire or just music-lovers looking for local events to attend don't have a specific avenue to search based on genre of music or availability.

### Solution:

An app that provides a community for both musicians and music-lovers. Can help matchmake a musician with a group needing another member, an event coordinator with local bands to hire for a gig, and also provides a main feed with listings for music events being held in the area.

## Technology Used:

- React
- React Router
- Redux/RTK/RTK Query
- MongoDB
- Webpack
- Express
- Node

## Stretch Features:

- A direct messanging system built into each profile so that members, no matter their role, can communicate directly within the app.
- Adding a review capability attached to each profile so that venues can review the musicians who perform and bands can also review the venues/event coordinators.
- Users can upload a profile photo that is stored on local storage and displayed on both their profile and on the main feed page.
- Filtering posts on the main feed to only display ones with certain tags.
